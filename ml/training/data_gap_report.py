LandPulse AI — Data Gap Report (Phase 3 Update)
=================================================
Documents why supervised delay prediction training is deferred.

This report is NOT an error — it is the correct response when
real public data cannot support a defensible supervised label.

Per Phase 3 specification:
  "If the available data cannot support a defensible supervised target:
   - do not invent one
   - do not claim delay probability
   - retain anomaly detection as an anomaly/risk signal
   - produce a documented data-gap report
   - implement the stage-intelligence architecture so supervised models
     can be plugged in when sufficient real outcome data exists."
